# The Eighteenth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt

## The New Kingdom

The Eighteenth Dynasty marks the beginning of the New Kingdom, a period of approximately 350 years during which ancient Egypt reached its apogee of power.

## Time of prosperity

The Eighteenth Dynasty is considered one of the most prosperous and powerful periods in ancient Egyptian history. Beginning with the rise of Ahmose I, who expelled the Hyksos invaders, the dynasty witnessed a golden age of Egyptian culture and military might. Pharaohs such as Queen Hatshepsut, Amenhotep III and the "heretic pharaoh" Akhenaten ruled during this time, overseeing a significant expansion of the empire through both conquest and diplomacy. The most widely known pharaoh in modern times is arguably Tutankhamun, whose tomb, containing a vast array of treasures, was discovered in 1922. 

## Achievements

The Eighteenth Dynasty is renowned for its artistic achievements, including the construction of monumental temples such as the Luxor and Karnak temples, as well as the development of the Amarna Period under Akhenaten.

## The list of Pharaohs

It is important to note that the chronological order of the pharaohs is an evolving subject and should therefore be treated with a certain degree of caution. As new research is conducted, the order may be subject to change, which is a fundamental principle that applies to all Egyptian dynasties.
