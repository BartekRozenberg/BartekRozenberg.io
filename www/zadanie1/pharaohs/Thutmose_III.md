# Thutmose III

Thutmose III (variously also spelt Tuthmosis or Thothmes), sometimes called Thutmose the Great, (1481-1425 BC) was the fifth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. A brilliant military commander who created the ancient world's first navy, he conducted campaigns that brought ancient Egypt's empire to its zenith.
Officially, Thutmose III ruled Egypt from his coronation on 28 April 1479 BC at the age of two until his death on 11 March 1425 BC. But for the first 22 years of his reign, he was coregent with his stepmother and aunt, Hatshepsut, who was named the pharaoh. He became sole ruler after Hatshepsut's death in 1458. Two years before his own death, and after the death of his firstborn son and heir Amenemhat, Thutmose III appointed his son and successor Amenhotep II as junior co-regent.
Thutmose III, who commanded Hatshepsut's armies, is regarded as one of the greatest warriors, military commanders, and military strategists of all time; as Egypt's preeminent warrior pharaoh and conqueror; and as a dominant figure in the New Kingdom period, itself considered the height of Egyptian power. He conducted between 17 and 20 campaigns, all victorious, while expanding Egypt's empire to its largest extent. He also created the ancient Egyptian navy, the first navy in the ancient world. His military campaigns are detailed in the inscriptions known as the Annals of Thutmose III. Historian Richard A. Gabriel referred to Thutmose III as the "Napoleon of Egypt".
